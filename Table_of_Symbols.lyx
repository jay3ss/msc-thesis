Traffic Flow Theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traffic may be modeled using different levels of models such as macroscopic,
 microscopic, mesoscopic, and aggregation and disaggregation levels 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "treiberkestingtfd"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Macroscopic models describe the aggregate behavior of traffic, similar
 to how hydrodynamic models describe the aggregate behavior of particles
 in liquids and gases.
 Microscopic models on the other hand describe the interactions and reactions
 of single vehicles with each other similar to multi-particle systems.
 Mesoscopic models are hybrids of macroscopic and microscopic models.
 Finally, aggregation and disaggregation is the use of microscopic quantities
 to describe macroscopic ones (aggregation) and using macroscopic quantities
 to describe microscopic ones (disaggregation).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The macroscopic quantities that are of interest are the speed (
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

), density (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

), and flow (
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

) of the vehicles.
 There are several different definitions of speed, but essentially speed
 is the distance traveled per unit time.
 Density is defined as the number of vehicles per unit length of road.
 Finally, flow is defined as the number of vehicles passing through a certain
 point in space per unit time.

Density,

 by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\end{equation}

 is the local speed of lane

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Hydrodynamic Flow Relation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Flow, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, is defined as the number of vehicles per unit time and is the product
 between density and velocity, as shown below
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Q\left(x,y\right)=\rho\left(x,t\right)V\left(x,t\right)\label{eq:lane-average-flow}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Flow can be given in terms of a single lane, all lanes, or as a lane-average
 (Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:lane-average-flow"
plural "false"

\end_inset

).
 Many times the flow in terms of all lanes will be used as the conservation
 of vehicles holds only for the total density, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{tot}$
\end_inset

, and not for each lane individually (vehicles can change lanes afterall).
 It should be noted that this relation holds for all types of macroscopic
 models, but not for all types of roads.
 In other words, the geometry of the road matters but not the model.
 For example, on- and off-ramps and a change in the number of lanes will
 change Equation

 In general, drivers try to keep a safe distance between themselves and
 the vehicle ahead of them.
 If they drive at velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 and have a response 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, then the minimum safe separation distance, 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{min}$
\end_inset

, is defined by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin{equation}
d_{\text{min}}=Tv\label{eq:shock-wave-min-safe-sep}

\begin_layout Standard
If all drivers are driving at a safe distance from one another, then the

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho=\frac{1}{\ell+Tv}\label{eq:shock-wave-traffic-density}

\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, is given by
\end_layout

Instabilities, in the form of waves in density and speed, grow in amplitude
 and may grow until the speed of the vehicles approach zero

.
 This phenomena can understood through positive feedback.
 Lower vehicle speeds cause higher traffic densities, which in turn cause
 lower speeds.
 On the other hand, higher speeds cause lower traffic densities, which cause
 higher speeds and so on (of course taking into account speed limits and
 safety considerations).
 Therefore, we can see that the system is amplifying the characteristics
 of traffic (vehicle speed and traffic density) rather than dampening them.
 This is characteristic of a system with positive feedback.
 In addition to the system having positive feedback, after a certain density,
 drivers braking can cause the vehicles behind them to brake, propagating
 the wave backwards through the roadway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Horn states that the root of the problem stems from the drivers‚Äô feedback
 and the flow of information.
 Drivers tend to perform actions that benefit themselves, but tend to be
 detrimental to other drivers.
 The flow of information on the road from vehicle to vehicle is unidirectional
 from the front vehicle to the back.
 Each vehicle adjusts its acceleration based on the relative position and
 velocity of the vehicle immediately ahead of it.
 The deceleration coupled with the backwards, unidirectional flow of information
 creates an effect that is similar to a shock wave is which also moves backwards
 through traffic

Connected and Autonomous Vehicles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Autonomous vehicles benefit the passengers of each individual vehicle, but
 not the rest of the vehicles on the road.
 As was shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Shock-Waves"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, traffic shock waves are created in part by the lack of traffic information
 to flow upstream in traffic.
 A means to counteract this is to actively share information between vehicles
 (V2V), infrastructure (V2I), and other devices (V2X).
 By vehicles sharing information such as speed, acceleration, and location
 and infrastructure relaying information such as road and weather conditions

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traffic congestion is caused by a cascade of driver decelerations down a
 roadway which, in turn, causes an increase in density of vehicles causing
 more driver decelerations, and so on.
 These cascaded decelerations cause a shock wave to move backwards through
 traffic that can be sustained even after the cause of the shock wave has
 disappeared.
 By sharing information throughout and coordinating vehicles within a platoon,
 these shock waves can be reduced.
 This increases highway capacity by a factor of 2 or 3, relieves congestion,
 reduces travel times, and decreases fuel consumption

Literature Review

Traffic research with vehicle platoons extends back to at least the 1950s
 with major development taking off in the 1990s a

 Currently, there has been an interest in research regarding modeling lane
 changing, control of platoons at intersections, and string stability of
 platoons.
 Much work with vehicle platoons has been completed in recent years.
 There are two different types of methods of coordinating vehicles that
 have been proposed in current research: centralized and decentralized coordinat
ion.
 In decentralized approaches, information is shared from vehicle to vehicle
 and in centralized approaches information is coordinated through a global
 coordinator.
 For example, in highway merging problems decentralized approaches handle
 each vehicle as an autonomous entity that aims to maximize efficiency.
 On the other hand, in centralized approaches vehicles are controlled by
 a global agent

The efficiency of traffic flow was quantified by Stern et.
 al.
 Experiments were conducted on a circular track as it represents an infinitely
 long straight track making it simple to identify stop and go waves (i.e.,
 shock waves).
 In the experiments, consisting of more than twenty non-autonomous vehicles,
 uniform speed could not be maintained.
 With the introduction of an autonomous vehicle at the front of the formation
 the vehicles reached the uniform, desired speed.

Kachroo et.

 used Mean Field Games and Radon measure with connected and normal vehicles
 to analyze hetergeneous traffic on a circular track.
 The connected vehicles were treated as discrete agents which could be used
 to control the overall traffic streams and entropy was used as a measure
 of traffic flow efficiency.
 Their analysis included the effect of various penetration levels of CAVs
 in traffic stream, their placement, and various sizes of circular track.
 It was shown that the use of connected vehicles improved the efficiency
 by lowering the entropy
