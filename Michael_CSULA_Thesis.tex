\makeabstract

The role of information spread and the impact it has on societies in the modern world cannot be understated. In the age of mass communication, digital misinformation, and social media, the importance of understanding and developing control mechanisms for information spread are doubly necessary. While traditional information spread has been examined in detail from a variety of angles over the decades, little attention has been given to the relatively recent phenomena of the super-fast spread of information via social media and the rise and impact of ``fake news" within said information networks. In Chapters \ref{chapter_motivation} through \ref{chapter_preliminaries}, a background of information spread theory, terminology, and applications are presented and organized in both a general setting and specifically as information spread applies to social media networks. The importance and influence of a network's structure to the spread of information is also discussed. In Chapters \ref{ch:DETERMINISTIC} through \ref{chapter_marketing}, several traditional dynamic models are presented, built upon, and re-framed in the modern context of social media information spread using differential equations. A new model is proposed to address networks and sets of adjacent networks in which information learned and spread is highly polarized, contentious, or unverified. In Chapters \ref{chapter_control_craze} and \ref{chapter_control_fake}, control mechanisms and strategies are examined and evaluated along with supporting social theory. These control strategies are developed and applied to sample case studies using the models discussed previously. The results from the proposed control methods of the sample scenarios are calculated, simulated, and discussed.

I would like to thank to L.A. Adamic, N. Glance, and Gallup for the use of their images in the spirit of academic advancement. Without these resources, my points would both less strong and accessible.

This work would	not	have been possible without the financial support of	California State University, Los Angeles and their generous academic grants and the support of the faculty and staff of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. I am especially indebted	to my professors during my time here who have been supportive	of my career goals and who have worked actively to help me to pursue those goals, as well as providing their extensive professional and personal guidance. I would also like to thank my thesis committee members for their input, advice, and interest in this work. 

I am grateful to all of	those with whom I have had the pleasure to work during this	and	other related projects.	I would especially like to thank Dr.~Shaurya Agarwal, the	chairman of	my committee. As my	teacher	and	mentor,	he has taught me more than I could ever give him credit for here. He has shown me, by his example, what a	good researcher, engineer (and person) should be.

Nobody has been	more important to me in	the	pursuit	of this	project	than the members	of	my	family.	I would	like to	thank	my	parents, whose love	and	guidance are with me in	whatever I pursue. They	are	the ultimate role models.	Most importantly, I wish to	thank my loving	and	supportive fianc\'ee, Liliane, who has	provided unending understanding, encouragement, and inspiration.

%Can you see the
%difference between the spacings after the periods in the
%following?
%
%Thanks to Dr. Brookfield. Thanks to Dr.~Brookfield. Thanks to Dr.~Brookfield. 
%
%\noindent It's subtle, but the space after the first ``Dr.'' is too big.  
%Normally \LaTeX\ assumes that a period is the end
%of a sentence and adds a bit of extra space before the start
%of the next sentence.  This is not you want after ``Dr.''
%and it can be avoided by using a tilde \verb|~| after the
%period.  The above example was made from
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%Thanks to Dr. Brookfield. Thanks to Dr.~Brookfield. Thanks to Dr.~Brookfield. 
%\end{verbatim}
%
%The tilde in \verb|Dr.~Brookfield| also means that \LaTeX\
%will not split ``Dr.''  and ``Brookfield'' across lines.
