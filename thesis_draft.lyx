\begin_layout Abstract
In this research paper, we aim to develop and test various control algorithms
 to mitigate shock waves in traffic streams consisting of connected and
 autonomous vehicles (CAVs).
 We first explain the formation of shock-waves with the help of mathematical
 modeling and numerical simulation.
 Further, we formulate an optimal control problem to mitigate shock waves
 on a circular track consisting of CAVs.
 We solve the optimal control problem using Pontryagin’s minimization principle.
 We use entropy to measure the effectiveness of CAVs to reduce shock waves
 (stop-and-go) waves on a circular track, thereby increasing throughput
 and reducing emissions.
 An optimal control law is also developed to minimize the error of the headway
 between vehicles in a platoon.

\emph on
Transportation has played an integral role in human society from the very
 beginning, allowing humans to colonize different geographical regions,
 trade amongst different civilizations, and to spread ideas.
 Initially, humans walked and carried items on their backs and heads.
 Beasts of burden such as mules or oxen were then used which allowed for
 more goods to be transported at a higher speed.
 Then, roads were built and people and goods were carried by wheeled carts.
 As transportation systems became more complex and advanced, people and
 goods were able to be transported further and at greater speeds.

Transportation has played an integral role in human society from the very
 beginning, allowing humans to colonize different geographical regions,

 Transport by land started by foot with people walking from place to place
 carrying goods on their backs and heads.
 By the early twentieth century, automobiles began to be mass produced in
 America.
 Initially they were seen as toys for the rich.

Traffic congestion, air and noise pollution, and safety are common problems
 that many cities face today.
 It is estimated that 50% of the total population is living in cities, and
 by 2050, this percentage is projected to grow over 70%, i.e.
 over six billion people will live in cities and urban areas.
 In 2014, U.S.
 drivers drove over 2 trillion vehicle miles, with congestion costing over
 5 billion dollars on average for very large urban areas and over 191 million
 dollars on average in small urban areas.
 In 2014, there was a reported 5.9 million accidents by passenger vehicles
 and the costs and accident rates are increasing on average across the nation

The transportation engineering and planning communities are witnessing the
 emergence of a new generation of traffic systems, also known as connected
 and autonomous vehicles (CAVs).
 Recent advancements in CAVs are expected to transform how people use transporta
tion.
 There is a growing interest in the research community to exploit the available
 vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication
 technologies in CAVs, to improve the efficiency and safety of traffic flow
 while reducing emissions.
 It is estimated that integration of CAVs will reduce about 40% of fatal
 traffic accidents

The ability to communicate between vehicles improves the perception of the
 driving environment and the quality of driving related decisions.
 V2V communications provide detailed information about vehicle movements
 and operation decisions (e.g.
 speed and acceleration), while V2I communications provide detailed information
 on road and weather conditions.
 The CAV is also able to obtain information from adjacent vehicles and predict
 the traffic stream parameters ahead of them (e.g., shockwave formations).
 The availability of V2I communications provides information on breakdown
 formations (e.g.
 lane closure or crash), changes in the speed limit, work zone conditions,
 and additional information

 User experiences are important for smoother transition to next generation
 technologies.
 Bansal and Kockelman performed a national survey to understand the future
 vehicle preferences related to CAV technology 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 As noted by the respondents, traffic sign recognition and left turn assist
 was of no interest, as about 46% of users were not willing to pay for the
 technologies to be added to their vehicles.
 However, respondents were very interested in a blind-spot monitoring system.
 As a result, many manufacturers implemented this technology in their vehicles.
 About 54.4% of the respondents perceived CAVs as a useful advancement in
 the near future.
 Furthermore, 50.4% of the respondents were comfortable with their vehicle
 transmitting information to other vehicles and 62.3% were willing to trust
 technology companies.
 Most users show signs of accepting the changes, and as CAV technology continues
 to advance, it will provide a positive impact on the future of mobility.

\begin_layout Section
Trends in Automation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like many other industries, the automotive industry is benefiting from the
 increasing capabilities and especially shrinking footprint of computers.
 Processing power is getting cheaper and because of this very powerful computers
 are able to fit into smaller volumes including the cramped spaces inside
 of motor vehicles.
 Not only are computers more powerful, smaller, and cheaper than ever before
 so are sensors.
 Lidar, radar, and cameras are (relatively) cheap, powerful, and have high
 resolution.
 Powerful computers and sensors in novel objects is fertile ground for innovatio
n.
 Large automakers and smaller startups (many funded by large companies and/or
 investors) are in a race to create the first autonomous vehicle.

Current Capabilities

SAE International breaks down autonomous vehicles into six automation levels.
 These levels are given in Table

\end_inset

 and are sourced from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The levels of automation range from the human driver being completely in
 control 100% of the time (Level 0) to an Advanced Driver System (ADS) is
 fully in control with no human intervention necessary (Level 5).
 A great example of advancing automation in the automotive industry is Tesla.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, Tesla's Autopilot (which is one of the most advanced ADS on the
 market) is at Level 2 which means that Tesla vehicles are capable of steering
 within a lane, maintaining a speed relative to other vehicles, assisting
 lane changes, parking, and summoning to and from garage.
 Tesla will continue to update the Autopilot on its vehicles (which Tesla
 will the Enhanced Autopilot), steadily adding new features such as automatic
 lane keeping, speed matching, lane changing, freeway exiting, parking (when
 near a parking space).
 Like many other car-makers, Tesla plans to eventually have its cars be
 self-driving

Research and Testing

\begin_layout Standard
There are many companies that are competing in the race to the elusive self-driv
ing car.
 Some of the biggest names are Uber, Waymo (formerly known as the Google
 self-driving car project), NVIDIA Corporation, and major car manufacturers
 such as Honda, GM Cruise LLC, and Tesla

 Because of the secretive nature of industrial research it's difficult to
 determine just how far along each company is towards achieving full autonomy
 for self-driving cars.
 However, one way to determine how far along companies are towards realizing
 a fully autonomous (Level 5) car is to examine documents that they are
 required to release.
 One such document is the Autonomous Vehicle Disengagement Report that the
 California Department of Motor Vehicles requires as a part of the licensing
 requirements for performing field tests on California roads under the Autonomou
s Vehicle Testing Program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Autonomous Vehicle Disengagement Reports contain the number of miles driven
 autonomously on public roads in California per month and disengagement
 events and related information.
 During field tests of autonomous vehicles, a driver (test operator) must
 be in the driver's seat of the vehicle 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 A disengagement event is 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a deactivation of the autonomous mode when a failure of the autonomous technolog
y is detected or when the safe operation of the vehicle requires that the
 autonomous vehicle test driver disengage the autonomous mode and take immediate
 manual control of the vehicle, or in the case of driverless vehicles, when
 the safety of the vehicle, the occupants of the vehicle, or the public
 requires that the autonomous technology be deactivated.

 A very simple (although perhaps a bit naive) method is to examine all of

 By doing so, a picture of each company's progress begins to emerge.

Integration of AI
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to Chen et al, in much of industry, mediated perception techniques
 for vision-based autonomous driving systems are used 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "chen2015deepdriving"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Mediated perception techniques use subcomponents to recognize traffic data
 such as other vehicles, lanes, traffic signs and signals, and pedestrians.
 This data is then combined to create a representation of the traffic scenario
 such as splines for lane detections and bounding boxes for vehicle detections.
 An AI-based control system can then take in this representation, determine
 appropriate trajectories, and actuate the vehicle.
 Chen et al.
 describe a few problems with this technique, however.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, the representation that is created can be too 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rich
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 meaning that not all of the information in the representation is necessary
 for the AI-based controller.
 Second, AI-controllers don't directly use this representation (i.e., it has
 to be transformed to some other representation that the controller 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 use) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "chen2015deepdriving"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 These transformations from splines and bounding boxes into useful information
 can create noise and errors that add more uncertainty to the mix.
 Third, structured details from the traffic scene such as straight edges
 in buildings can cause false positives for other vehicles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another technique is behavior reflex approach 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "chen2015deepdriving"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In this technique, sensory input (e.g., radar, lidar, and images) is mapped
 to driving actions (e.g., steering angles and accelerations or braking) using
 neural networks.
 Although straightforward, this technique has flaws.
 First, driving conditions are never the same.
 Even if the same cars are in the same location at the same time of day,
 people have different moods and intentions and may exhibit different a
 behavior.
 Second, the neural network must process an entire image and determine the
 relevant parts which is difficult for the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Obstacles and Limitations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A hurdle for obtaining level 5 autonomy is that of data.
 Training neural networks takes a lot of data, which is why we see manufacturers
 performing extensive field tests.
 Also, it is necessary to prove that these vehicles are safe and currently
 the way to prove this is through real-world tests.
 The RAND Corporation estimates that in order for autonomous vehicles to
 match the safety rate of human drivers (about 1 fatality in 100 million
 miles driven) autonomous vehicles need to have in the range of billions
 to hundreds of billions of test miles driven, which could take hundreds
 (or even thousands) of years depending on the size of the test fleet and
 how much better it is desired for the autonomous vehicles to be than human
 drivers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kalrapaddoc2016rand"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This is why Tesla is running tests using its customers' vehicles as its
 own test fleet.
 The more vehicles it has, the faster Tesla can improve and prove its technology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another limitation of the current implementation of autonomy in industry
 is the lack of coordination of autonomous vehicles and sharing of information.
 As far publications go, no car companies are talking about if and how their
 vehicles will share information with infrastructure (V2I) and each other
 (V2V).
 Some companies, such as Tesla and Waymo, are discussing about eventually
 having an autonomous ride-hailing service 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "waymoridehailing,teslamasterplan2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, the lack of sharing information about the vehicles and coordination
 with other vehicles on the road (including private vehicles) can prove
 to be problematic for the larger picture.
 Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) can increase the throughput and efficiency
 of roads and highways, but a necessity is the sharing of information between
 vehicles on the road due to faster response times and the shorter distances
 (headways) needed between vehicles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "rios2017automated"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 If this information is not shared then it will be difficult to glean these
 efficiencies and much of the improvements of autonomous vehicles will not
 be realized.

Overview of Traffic Flow Theory

Traffic may be modeled using different levels of models such as macroscopic,
 microscopic, mesoscopic, and aggregation and disaggregation levels 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "treiberkestingtfd"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Macroscopic models describe the aggregate behavior of traffic, similar
 to how hydrodynamic models describe the aggregate behavior of particles
 in liquids and gases.
 Microscopic models on the other hand describe the interactions and reactions
 of single vehicles with each other similar to multi-particle systems.
 Mesoscopic models are hybrids of macroscopic and microscopic models.
 Finally, aggregation and disaggregation is the use of microscopic quantities
 to describe macroscopic ones (aggregation) and using macroscopic quantities
 to describe microscopic ones (disaggregation).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The macroscopic quantities that are of interest are the speed (

), density (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

), and flow (
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

) of the vehicles.
 There are several different definitions of speed, but essentially speed
 is the distance traveled per unit time.
 Density is defined as the number of vehicles per unit length of road.
 Finally, flow is defined as the number of vehicles passing through a certain
 point in space per unit time.

 This phenomena can understood through positive feedback.
 Lower vehicle speeds cause higher traffic densities, which in turn cause
 lower speeds.
 On the other hand, higher speeds cause lower traffic densities, which cause
 higher speeds and so on (of course taking into account speed limits and
 safety considerations).
 Therefore, we can see that the system is amplifying the characteristics
 of traffic (vehicle speed and traffic density) rather than dampening them.
 This is characteristic of a system with positive feedback.
 In addition to the system having positive feedback, after a certain density,
 drivers braking can cause the vehicles behind them to brake, propagating
 the wave backwards through the roadway.

\begin_layout Standard
Horn states that the root of the problem stems from the drivers’ feedback
 and the flow of information.
 Drivers tend to perform actions that benefit themselves, but tend to be
 detrimental to other drivers.
 The flow of information on the road from vehicle to vehicle is unidirectional
 from the front vehicle to the back.
 Each vehicle adjusts its acceleration based on the relative position and
 velocity of the vehicle immediately ahead of it.
 The deceleration coupled with the backwards, unidirectional flow of information
 creates an effect that is similar to a shock wave is which also moves backwards
 through traffic

Platoons are an ideal remedy to driving situations for peak traffic conditions
 such as at intersections and highways.
 Traffic congestion is caused by a cascade of driver decelerations down
 a roadway which, in turn, causes an increase in density of vehicles causing
 more driver decelerations, and so on.
 These cascaded decelerations cause a shock wave to move backwards through
 traffic that can be sustained even after the cause of the shock wave has
 disappeared.
 By sharing information throughout and coordinating vehicles within a platoon,
 these shock waves can be reduced.
 This increases highway capacity by a factor of 2 or 3, relieves congestion,
 reduces travel times, and decreases fuel consumption

\begin_layout Subsection
Theory of Traffic Shock Waves
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The formation of traffic shock waves can be explained using the LWR model,
 although with some limitation.
 Let's define the initial density of the traffic flow to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(x,0\right)=\rho_{0}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\left(x,t\right)=\rho_{0}\left(x-\widetilde{c}t\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\widetilde{c}$
\end_inset

 is the propagation velocity of the density waves.
 We can see that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}=-\widetilde{c}\rho_{0}'\left(x-\widetilde{c}t\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial x}=\rho_{0}'\left(x-\widetilde{c}t\right)$
\end_inset

 which, when combined with Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:lwr-cont-eq-model-q"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 (the LWR model) leads to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-\widetilde{c}\,\rho_{0}'\left(x-\widetilde{c}t\right)+\frac{dQ_{e}}{d\rho}\rho_{0}'\left(x-\widetilde{c}t\right)=0
\]

\end_inset

or
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\widetilde{c}\left(\rho\right)=\frac{dQ_{e}}{d\rho}=\frac{d\left(\rho V_{e}\left(\rho\right)\right)}{d\rho}}\label{eq:lwr-density-prop-vel}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This shows that density waves propagate at a velocity dependent on the change
 in the flow of traffic.
 This important result will be used to help explain the formation of traffic
 shock waves later.
 If we examine the density wave propagation from the point of view of driver
 we get
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\widetilde{c}_{\text{rel}}\left(\rho\right)=\, & \widetilde{c}\left(\rho\right)-V\\
=\, & \widetilde{c}\left(\rho\right)-V_{e}\left(\rho\right)\\
=\, & \rho V'_{e}\left(\rho\right)
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:lwr-rel-density-prop-vel}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $V'_{e}\left(\rho\right)<0$
\end_inset

, thus, from the driver's perspective when 
\begin_inset Formula $\widetilde{c}_{\text{rel}}\left(\rho\right)\leq0$
\end_inset

 the density variations propagate backwards.

\begin_inset Formula $c_{12}=\frac{dx_{12}}{dt}$

 Currently, there has been an interest in research regarding modeling lane
 changing, control of platoons at intersections, and string stability of
 platoons.
 Much work with vehicle platoons has been completed in recent years.
 There are two different types of methods of coordinating vehicles that
 have been proposed in current research: centralized and decentralized coordinat
ion.
 In decentralized approaches, information is shared from vehicle to vehicle
 and in centralized approaches information is coordinated through a global
 coordinator.
 For example, in highway merging problems decentralized approaches handle
 each vehicle as an autonomous entity that aims to maximize efficiency.
 On the other hand, in centralized approaches vehicles are controlled by
 a global agent

The efficiency of traffic flow was quantified by Stern et.

 Experiments were conducted on a circular track as it represents an infinitely
 long straight track making it simple to identify stop and go waves (i.e.,
 shock waves).
 In the experiments, consisting of more than twenty non-autonomous vehicles,
 uniform speed could not be maintained.
 With the introduction of an autonomous vehicle at the front of the formation
 the vehicles reached the uniform, desired speed.

Kachroo et.

 used Mean Field Games and Radon measure with connected and normal vehicles
 to analyze hetergeneous traffic on a circular track.
 The connected vehicles were treated as discrete agents which could be used
 to control the overall traffic streams and entropy was used as a measure
 of traffic flow efficiency.
 Their analysis included the effect of various penetration levels of CAVs
 in traffic stream, their placement, and various sizes of circular track.
 It was shown that the use of connected vehicles improved the efficiency
 by lowering the entropy

Field trials for testing of communication protocols and control algorithms

\begin_inset Formula $U_{min}\leq u\left(t\right)\leq U_{max}$

\begin_inset Formula $U_{min}$
\end_inset

 is a negative real number and

 is a positive real number.
 There are also constraints on the states such that the vehicles cannot
 go backwards (negative velocity) and they cannot exceed the speed limit,
 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq v_{i}\left(t\right)\leq v_{max}$

There are various error functions that can be used.
 Three in particular are of interest for platooning with the testbed due
 to the variety of behaviors that they encourage and are given in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:error-functions"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The first error function, 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i}\left(t\right)=h_{i}\left(t\right)-h_{isafe}$
\end_inset

, penalizes deviations from the desired safety distance and is the error
 function that will be examined in this paper.
 The second error function, 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i}\left(t\right)=h_{i+1}\left(t\right)-h_{i}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

, penalizes differences between headways of consecutive vehicles essentially
 forcing an even spacing between every car in the platoon.
 Finally, 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i}\left(t\right)=v_{i+1}\left(t\right)-v_{i}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

, penalizes deviations in speed between the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $i+1^{th}$
\end_inset

 vehicles.

 Using the error function

 part with respect to

 This gives us
\begin_inset Formula

 partially with respect to the control action variable

Because

\begin_inset Formula $\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 is constrained to be 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{min}^{i}\leq u_{i}\left(t\right)\leq U_{max}^{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}^{i*}\left(t\right)$

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

 cannot always hold.
 Therefore, it is necessary to find the conditions in which the relationship
 does indeed hold and, if it doesn't, what to apply as 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Luckily, this is rather straightforward.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}^{i*}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 goes beyond the allowable limits for 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\left(t\right)$
